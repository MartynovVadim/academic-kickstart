I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Economics at Caltech supervised by [Omer Tamuz](http://tamuz.caltech.edu/). My research is in Microeconomic Theory, more specifically in Social Learning, Networks and Game Theory. I am interested in how information is aggregated in society and how it can be improved.

I also participate in an annual Chicago Quantitative Alliance Challenge where the goal is to successfully run a virtual hedge fund.
